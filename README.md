# Kafka REST Proxy from .NET

This is a simple example of how to integrate with Confluent's [REST Proxy](https://github.com/confluentinc/kafka-rest) from C#.

Note: It's better to use the [.NET Kafka Client](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-dotnet) instead in most cases - it's more performant and feature rich.
